			<h2>25 September 2021</h2>
			<p>Booted my old laptop up for the first time in a year and a half. Works like a charm, god I miss this old
				keyboard. Feels like I can type twice as fast on this.</p>
			<p>Working on the website again, just to freshen up the links and Refactor it a bit. I'm thinking about
				putting a rudimenty food blog on the website. Just reviewing local chicago joints. Nothing clear yet,
				just looking for an outlet</p>

			<h2>15 March 2019 </h2>
			<p>Currently on the plane right now flying back from Seattle to Chicago for spring break with Yash. I had a
				good week walking around the city and doing a lot of hiking. We started the week with our friend Erin
				from Purdue at San Juan Island. We visited Pike's place a few times and got some good food there. It was
				great seeing such a beautiul city.</p>

			<h2>14 July 1944</h2>
			<p>Honey, I am writing to you from the trenches of versailles, the war has been long and hard but
				thankfully I have these blog posts for you to see. Hopefully tomorrow we can get a group pic for the
				gram to cheer us up. Me and the mates have been working out lately and are looking pretty cut. Sorry
				i have been getting distracted. What am I doing here again?? Is this a joke blog or am I just bored
				because its 3 AM right now at Purdue.</p>
