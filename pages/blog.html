			<h2>25 September 2022</h2>
			<p>Wasted a ton of time last year trying to get a google maps api project working for this website. Eventually i nuked the idea
				because i want to keep this website static. Just some html pages, images and links.
			</p>
			<p>I booted up my 3d printer again. its a printrbot simple metal from 2014 and it still works like a freaking charm. i've been printing so
				much with it lately. Idk why for sure, but i just like it and have so much more success with it now than i did when i was in high school.
				I think i'm just smarter now and i have better ideas about what i want and need, and i have a better engineering mindset of trial and error
				with the thing. Check out my printables profile below to see what i've designed or made.
			</p>
			<p>I also have a new 3d printer coming soon. The Ankermake v5 printer. I'm beyond stoked to try this thing out. Anker is such a good company
				i'm happy to be their guinea pig for the first run of this thing. Plus i got such a good deal from the kickstarter, basically half off.
				I'm sure there will be lots more to post on printables soon.
			</p>
			<p>Oh wow, same day as last year, spooky...</p>

			<h2>25 September 2021</h2>
			<p>Booted my old laptop up for the first time in a year and a half. Works like a charm, god I miss this old
				keyboard. Feels like I can type twice as fast on this.</p>
			<p>Working on the website again, just to freshen up the links and Refactor it a bit. I'm thinking about
				putting a rudimenty food blog on the website. Just reviewing local chicago joints. Nothing clear yet,
				just looking for an outlet</p>

			<h2>15 March 2019 </h2>
			<p>Currently on the plane right now flying back from Seattle to Chicago for spring break with Yash. I had a
				good week walking around the city and doing a lot of hiking. We started the week with our friend Erin
				from Purdue at San Juan Island. We visited Pike's place a few times and got some good food there. It was
				great seeing such a beautiul city.</p>
