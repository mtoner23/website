			<h2>Tlahco</h2>
			<h2>1 Star</h2>
			<p>Lincoln Park's newest taco joint had a lot of promise. Instagrammable tortilla colors. Hand drawn chalk
				menu. Goregous new
				Interior. Killer location. They boast of their authenticity and how they are family owned. All great
				qualities in todays modern world. The issues start with the tacos.</p>

			<h2>BlueBird</h2>
			<h2>5 Stars</h2>
			<p>God I love bluebird. Big sandwiches, great prices, fantastic sides, and wonderful sauces. Bluebird hits
				it out of the park again and again. Try the German Bird, or the Bluebird and get any of the sides; none
				of them will let you down. This is the spot I bring people to, to sell them on Chicago. Its
				around the corner from me and better than any brew pub sandwich you can get in the suburbs, for the same
				price. Next time you're in lakeview you have to stop in bluebird.</p>
