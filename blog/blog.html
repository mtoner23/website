	<p>Honey, I am writing to you from the trenches of versailles, the war has been long and hard but thankfully I have these blog posts for you to see. Hopefully tomorrow we can get a group pic for the gram to cheer us up. Me and the mates have been working out lately and are looking pretty cut. Sorry i have been getting distracted. What am I doing here again?? Is this a joke blog or am I just bored because its 3 AM right now at Purdue.</p>
