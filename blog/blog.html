			<h2>15 March 2019 </h2>
			<p>Currently on the plane right now flying back from Seattle to Chicago for spring break with Yash. I had a good week walking around the city and doing a lot of hiking. We started the week with our friend Erin from Purdue at San Juan Island. We visited Pike's place a few times and got some good food there. It was great seeing such a beautiul city.</p>

			<p>Honey, I am writing to you from the trenches of versailles, the war has been long and hard but thankfully I have these blog posts for you to see. Hopefully tomorrow we can get a group pic for the gram to cheer us up. Me and the mates have been working out lately and are looking pretty cut. Sorry i have been getting distracted. What am I doing here again?? Is this a joke blog or am I just bored because its 3 AM right now at Purdue.</p>
